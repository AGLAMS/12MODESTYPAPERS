      <p><strong>CON: Banning all phones in school</strong> </p><p>With billions of pupils using phones at school—mostly young people like teenagers—phones have become a significant problem on social media sites. As education keeps progressing, phones can be used anywhere, unlike in traditional schools, and they can either be useful or distracting. It might be beneficial for teaching. The current study focuses on a new and significant field of human-computer behavior research: the control of students' mobile phone use in K–12 education. In the past, several laws and regulations have been put in place in response to the issues that arise when new technologies are introduced in schools.</p>
      <p>According to these estimates, every kid may soon have a mobile phone that is genuinely personalized for their education at school, similar to their own pens and textbooks, for the first time in human history. Since mobile phones are becoming the most common technology with the claimed capabilities of everywhere, every time, everything, and everyone, this calls for and challenges mobile phone control in schools.</p>
      <p>Mobile phones are the cutting-edge technology that we have at our fingers nowadays. Considering this, permitting teenagers to use cell phones in educational settings, such as schools, has become a contentious issue. In addition to enabling students to maintain relationships with friends and family, mobile phones are an excellent educational tool that encourages responsible technology use.</p>
      <p>The widespread usage of social media by youth and the use of cell phones in classrooms are topics of increasing discussion. Social media and mobile phone use are both said to be detrimental to kids' study and mental health.</p>
      <p>Since technology is a part of practically every part of our life, it is worthwhile to consider the reasons why cell phones need to be permitted in schools. Digital tools may greatly improve the campus experience and expedite administration.</p>
      <p>There are several justifications for cell phones on campus, including the ability to research school activities, take part in surveys or group discussions, and even exchange points for school merchandise. Schools that are amenable to the concept but concerned about misuse might set up explicit rules to control use, guaranteeing that the gadgets fulfill a useful function without becoming a distraction.</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Uses for Educational Tools:</strong>
          <p>Opinion: For a wide range of age groups, mobile phones may serve as instructional resources.</p>
          <p>Support: Using platforms and applications that help with learning, such as interactive study and revision resources (GCSEpod), educational games (Reading Eggs), and language learning apps (Duolingo).</p>
        </li>
  
        <li><strong>2. Organization and Time Management:</strong>
          <p>Opinion: Students may efficiently manage their time by using their phones to plan activities and assignments, make to-do lists, and set reminders. It might help students keep on top of their studies and increase their productivity.</p>
          <p>Support: Electronic homework aids and applications that provide students rapid access to their schedules are used by many institutions. The daily task of reprinting misplaced schedules or chatting with parents about homework they were unaware their child had is familiar to everyone who worked in schools prior to the contemporary software that contains timetables. Parents can learn more about the assignments their children have been given.</p>
        </li>
  
        <li><strong>3. Communication Impairment:</strong>
          <p>Opinion: For older students in particular, cellphones can be crucial for calling parents or guardians in an emergency. It can limit accessibility and cause needless concern to ban them. Cell phones can be utilized in lockdown situations and power outages.</p>
          <p>Support: Cellphones are helpful for the safety of students who drive to campus or take public transportation. If a kid has a cell phone, they may instantly communicate information with their parents and professors.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>Although students' phone addiction may be an issue, schools ought to permit pupils to bring their phones to class. Let's examine the advantages and how much simpler life is instead of focusing on all the drawbacks.</p>
      <p>People think that technology is making life more difficult for people, but they fail to see that intelligent people will be inventing new technologies to make life easier in the future.</p>

      <p><strong>PRO: Two Child Policy per Household</strong></p> <p> The world's growing population is causing big problems, including environmental degradation. As more people consume resources, they create waste pollution that can degrade the environment and also increase demand for things like food, water, housing, healthcare, transportation, and more. To address these issues, implementing a two-child policy per household is a practical solution. This policy ensures that everyone has enough resources like food, water, and housing. With fewer people, living standards improve and poverty decreases. This policy is also implemented in China to stabilize their population and give penalties for those who exceed the limit. The two-child policy boosted the economy of the country, as it decreased the consumed resources, produced less waste, and gave a more balanced and well-off future for all citizens.</p>
      
      <p>Others believe that overpopulation is not the primary reason for environmental degradation and lack of resources in the country. They believe that these issues are caused by poor governance, mismanagement of the natural resources, and unequal distribution of wealth. They claim that addressing these issues is more effective than implementing a two-child policy, which contradicts the family's freedom and rights to choose family size. While it's true that poor governance and mismanagement of resources contribute to environmental degradation and lack of resources, overpopulation is worsening these problems by increasing the demand for resources, which is limited, and adding waste pollution. Two-child policy not only addresses overpopulation and poor governance; it also promotes responsible family planning that helps to stabilize population growth, allocating resources properly, and supporting sustainable development.</p>
  
      <p>Firstly, a two-child policy will improve access to public services. With fewer people, public services like schools and hospitals will serve people better. Overcrowded schools and hospitals lead to a lack of attention and proper services for everyone. With fewer people, it ensures better education and healthcare. Other systems will improve, like transportation and housing, with fewer people.</p>
  
      <p>Secondly, two-child policy can help decrease poverty. Families with fewer members can focus their resources on giving their children's lives better. Parents can invest more in their children's education and healthcare. Small family sizes are less likely to struggle financially, which lessens poverty.</p>
  
      <p>Lastly, two-child policy can protect the environment. Fewer people can lessen the waste pollution and damage to the environment. Overpopulation leads to deforestation, mining, and pollution. Fewer people can reduce these problems. Managing population growth will decrease the demand for natural resources and preserve them for future generations.</p>
  
      <p>Implementing a two-child policy is essential to reduce poverty, protect the environment, and improve public services. By controlling the population growth, we can ensure better allocation of resources and have more sustainable development for the nation. To implement this policy effectively, the government should invest in family planning education, provide accessible healthcare services, and support families through resources like childcare and financial assistance. These steps will help to create a more balanced and well-off future for the Philippines.</p>

      <p><strong>PRO: Protecting Filipinomigrant workers</strong> </p> <p> The Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) are one of the saluted workers of the Philippines. They are contributing tons of money to support their families back home. They are hailed as modern-day heroes, contributing to the Philippine economy through payment that give local development.</p>
      
      <p>OFWs offers a significant role in the Philippines. They contribute a lot of money in the Philippines which consider for a significant part of the country’s wealth. These workers often seek employment abroad to provide great income, and better opportunities for their families due to low wage economic likelihood at home.</p>
  
      <p>To ensure their safety and well-being, the government needs to step in and strengthen their safety by arranging a balanced agreement, enhancing foreign services, and putting comprehensive programs, this needs to address for their vulnerability and safety that put workers at risk while boosting their contribution to the country.</p>
  
      <p>While strengthening their safety, some of them say that the Philippine Government lacks support for OFWs. The government should focus on their safety instead of creating more domestic employment opportunities in other countries that could affect their welfare.</p>
  
      <p>Additionally, despite traveling so far to support their family, OFWs face a lot of challenges, including unfair labor practices, illegalized working conditions, and both physically and emotionally abusive environments. Domestic workers are the ones who often feel vulnerable due to limited legal protections in some other countries.</p>
  
      <p>Many OFWs face critical punishments such as exploitation, abuse, lack of salary, and lack of support from both their head and the Philippine government. It is overly crucial that the Philippines strengthens the protections for OFWs to ensure their safety, welfare, and dignity.</p>
  
      <p>That said, by ensuring their own safety and well-being, it’s a practical obligation for the government to take actions by strengthening their safety, such as improving two-sided industry agreements, stepping up emergency support, and providing complete integrated programs. The Philippines can do better protections for OFWs from exploitation and physical abuse abroad.</p>
  
      <p>By protecting them, the government should expand “Pre-Departure Training Programs” so that they can cope with strategies for workplace challenges, improving the reinterpretation programs for OFWs who can provide financial training, access to livelihood, and start a small business.</p>

      <p><strong>PRO: social media platforms should implement strict age verification to protect minors online</strong> </p><p> Social media platforms have become a base of communication and entertainment. As their impact grows, so do problems about the safety of minors. Young users are continuously exposed to improper content and cyberbullying.</p>
      
      <p>To protect children using age verification can be a challenging issue with no easy solutions. While such solutions address problems about kid safety and access to inappropriate content, they would be hard to execute. These would help protect children online. Even with these solutions in place, the involvement of parents and educators plays an important role in keeping children safe online.</p>
  
      <p>Social media platforms should implement strong age verification methods to keep minors from online dangers. This approach will significantly minimize their exposure to inappropriate content while also encouraging a safer environment for children.</p>
  
      <p>Strict age verification on social media is important for making the online world safer for kids. It limits their exposure to harmful content and it gives them the appropriate content for their age.</p>
  
      <p>Age verification on social media platforms comes with its pros and cons, but recent technological advances have positive results. For example, a convolutional neural network or CNN proved reliable according to Tananjaya (2023). Furthermore, a ResNet-50 with a 50-layer deep-trained version of the CNN obtained a rate of 78% reliability in the experimental phase of the said tool (Tananjaya et al., 2023). Another study using CNN on ear biometrics revealed that age detection has a 98.75% accuracy in identifying users as under or over 18 (Alghieth et al., 2019).</p>
  
      <p>While strong age verification is necessary for building a safer online environment, the implementation of these procedures needs to be significantly improved to assure effectiveness and reduce potential risks. Strict age verification is necessary, but it must be improved to ensure that it meets its promises. Platforms may build safer online places by enhancing technical reliability, standardizing processes, and adhering to ethical values.</p>
  
      <p>Age verification reduces minors’ exposure to harmful content.</p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Strict age verification reduces the likelihood that minors would access improper or dangerous materials, such as explicit content or violent media.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Bryant & Meshkov (2023), demonstrate that youngsters frequently access platforms by misrepresenting their age, exposing themselves to unregulated, adult-oriented sites. Age verification, such as AI-driven detection or standardized registration, can precisely identify users' ages and limit access to harmful regions.</p>
  
      <p>Age verification helps to reduce cyberbullying and exploitation.</p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Age verification decreases the danger of exploitation and cyberbullying by limiting underage users' access to social media or ensuring that their profiles are properly designated.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> (Thierer, 2007) argues that a diverse approach involving education, parental involvement, and law enforcement efforts is recommended to enhance online safety for minors (Thierer, 2007).</p>
  
      <p>Age verification encourages safer, age-appropriate interactions.</p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Accurate verification helps platforms tailor content and interactions to certain age groups, resulting in healthier online engagement.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Schneble (2021) pushes for standardized methods to ensure that children interact in safe and age-appropriate digital environments. This strategy is consistent with the principles of child protection, making sure that children are not only protected from inappropriate content but also empowered with social and educational knowledge.</p>
  
      <p>In conclusion, a strong age verification for social media is crucial, especially for minors. Not only it will give the younger generation solid protection from disturbing content online, but it will also give them proper knowledge about the dangers online.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Action Plan:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Improve technical reliability:</strong> Invest in advanced technologies like AIs, the tools must be tested rigorously to avoid risks and potential danger.</li>
        <li><strong>Safeguard privacy:</strong> To address privacy issues, consider implementing privacy-protecting techniques like the encryption of sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Promote Education and Awareness:</strong> Implement campaigns that would spread awareness and educate parents and children about the dangers of online content.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor and improve continuously:</strong> Regularly examine age verification tools and update the said tools when needed to keep up with advancements in technology.</li>

      <p><strong>PRO: Awareness of poverty drives government and NGO programs</strong> Alleviation of poverty continues to be one of the most crucial tasks in modern society and tens of millions of people suffer every single day because of it. To tackle such issues, both governments and NGOs need to develop and implement coherent strategies that are effective in reducing poverty.</p>
  
      <p>A high incidence of public knowledge and understanding of poverty is believed to facilitate faster and more effective actions by NGOs and governments in devising and carrying out their initiatives.</p>
  
      <p>Government and non-government organization actions are greatly influenced by public awareness of poverty. In addition to motivating lawmakers to act, a campaign that drew attention to the impoverished also boosts financing at reducing poverty and fostering international cooperation.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> As campaigns might not necessarily lead immediately to policy change, they do serve to catalyze other events, including but not limited to, grassroots movements, raising resources for nonprofit organizations, and nurturing the spirit of civic duty amongst the populace. These campaigns keep poverty alive and in active discussion, and this inertia contributes to society’s progress towards eventual resolutions of the increased focus toward poverty and mutual efforts to eradicate it.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Counter claim:</strong> Sadly, public awareness campaigns are in many cases overexposed, since they do not frequently lead to changes in policies pertaining to poverty but rather awareness of these policies. Their objectives are to make the issue of poverty remain relevant to the policymakers, but most of the time, they do not change the status quo into action or policy change. This gap renders them ineffective because there is no use in just showing problems without any development or solution to the said issues.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Supporting Claims</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Media campaigns increase the level of awareness of poverty and as such call for action to be taken now.</li>
        <li>People are made aware of poverty reduction and this inspires them to reach into their pockets to fund NGOs.</li>
        <li>When information is made public, more people are able to join forces with the aim of trying to come up with strategies to help the less fortunate.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>While it's true that public awareness campaigns have weaknesses and can be easily used for discussion, or they can be political or economic campaigns, it has to be said that it is one of the most efficient tools in the struggle against the most severe problems, such as poverty. There are several organizations around the world that try to spread information among people as well as use the knowledge to be in place with the activities of the governments and non-governmental organizations.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Evidence for the arguments:</strong></p>
      <p>Even if election-time initiatives are introduced, they are capable of giving prominence to questions of poverty, dispensing resources, and enabling gratification to the needy. These projects frequently assist in maintaining relief assistance to attend to the needs of poor people and at the same time ensure poverty remains a topical issue in society. The pitch during these periods revolves around numerous government initiatives, which appear to be more of an election strategy rather than a genuine concern to solve the alarming problem of poverty.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Argument 1:</strong> Political objectives help in accentuating campaigns that aim at alleviating poverty, creating awareness as regards poverty, and availing of resources to tackle poverty.</p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Many political objectives tend to influence poverty initiatives through campaigns that create awareness and mobilize the necessary resources towards poverty.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Many times, politicians in their campaigns include poverty initiatives that raise poverty concerns and alleviate resources to the poor regions.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Argument 2:</strong> Donor goals follow poverty initiatives carried out by NGOs and enhance the chances of achieving effective programs aimed at poverty alleviation.</p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Always attention is given to areas that interest the donor making sure that the NGO’s program achieves objectives on poverty alleviation.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Several NGOs are known to solicit and depend on foreign donors to undertake their activities and such goals often influence the type of programs implemented. This creates a means to fund the initiated large-scale activities.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Argument 3:</strong> Hitherto neglected economic interests become the prime motives for sustainable poverty reduction programs.</p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> In the majority, poverty alleviation strategies aim to sustain the workforce and promote long-term development that is in the interest of the poor and the larger nation too.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> The elimination of poverty through such programs is beneficial because these programs also embrace the poor while broadening the economic base. Jobs are created, livelihoods are improved, and poverty is eradicated.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Restating the arguments:</strong> Government and non-governmental organization (NGO) activities, although influenced by the expectations of the donor, political goals, and economic motives, are great and indispensable means in the fight against poverty. Such motivations assist in garnering the necessary funds, raising the needed level of awareness, and even providing assurance that poverty reduction initiatives will be prioritized in the concerned quarters and globally.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Action Plan:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Creating the planning and implementation of programs more open and accountable to the people:</strong> This will build confidence and ensure that the needed resources are well channeled to areas where poverty is most needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Project resting on the needs of the community where donor funds are aimed:</strong> This can be done by involving local communities in the perspective of the projects so that specific problems can be solved thus making such projects more viable in the long run.</li>
        <li><strong>Encouraging the affected communities, NGOs, and the state to work together:</strong> Joint effort makes it possible to ensure that a particular area’s measures in the fight against poverty are context-specific and in all likelihood, durable.</li>

      <p><strong>CON: death penalties in the Philippines</strong></p>
      <p>The death penalty has for a long time been a contentious issue among the peoples of the Philippines, with debates going on as to the applicability of the punishment to achieving justice as well as reducing crime. It’s commonplace for proponents to say, in this regard, that it acts as a disincentive and provides retribution for the victims of violence, especially in the more barbaric criminal acts. But the subject is still laden with ethical, legal, and practical questions.</p>
      
      <p>On a historical note, the Philippines abolished the death penalty in the year 2006, admitting the chances of irrevocable mistakes being made in judicial trials and its lack of deterrent. Even so, calls for its restoration have been demonstrated in recent years – rising complaints about crime and weak administration of justice systems have increased its popularity as well. This context provides an impetus and a deeper understanding of the reasons why it is necessary to analyze the issue of the use of capital punishment in the Philippines with such great care.</p>
  
      <p>Why the death penalty is considered to be such an inhumane and barbaric practice, otherwise known as ‘capital punishment,’ should not be brought back into practice in the Philippines is its pattern of deterrence does not work, it puts to death the innocent, and it disregards the essential provisions of international human rights law.</p>
  
      <p>The death penalty advocates posit that it is the ultimate form of punishment for the criminal and acts as a deterrent for crime in societies. They think that because of the death penalty, people wanting to commit bad deeds think twice and this helps secure the safety of the people. In addition to this, they also maintain that enforcement of the death penalty helps the victims and society in common to move on and thus restores order in the society after a terrible criminal act takes place.</p>
  
      <p>Nonetheless, the proof is not there. Studies done within the country and across the borders have shown that the death penalty does not prevent crime more than life imprisonment or other moderate penalties. For the repeat offenders, they will want to evade capture and thus this is what will push them to commit crimes and not fear of the punishment. In the case of the Philippines, law enforcement and judicial systems do not take place effectively, then the deterrent argument becomes even weaker.</p>
  
      <p>Furthermore, the argument of the execution for justice fails to appreciate the fact that justice is administered by people and people make mistakes. There is a real danger of the conviction of the innocent because of confessions obtained under duress, poor defense, and crooked systems. There are many incidents in the world where innocent people have been convicted and sentenced to death, and these cases together with many of its aspects underscore the horrors of capital punishment.</p>
  
      <p>The death penalty argument seems interesting and complex. On the one hand, in contrast, the opponents argue that an execution has never worked and does not solve crimes. Similar countries who do not execute and rather be humane and reform their criminals tend to have the same or lower crime rates. For instance, the Philippines is an archipelago where criminality is fueled primarily by socio-economic elements such as lack of education. Therefore, in order to deal with the predicaments, execution should not be applied to people but rather focus on eradicating the originating issues.</p>
  
      <p>Thirdly, in the significance of the argument, an unfair legal system begs for the death punishment to be detached from the Philippines. Legal malpractice is much more real than it appears, as multiple studies demonstrate how frequently the wrong people are convicted. Most nations abolishing it focused on this when focusing on matters in a different light. Doing so in this modern world would be completely ignorant of the consequences it may have on people, especially those wrongfully accused, is utterly ludicrous.</p>
  
      <p>To begin with, the death penalty is unjustifiable as there are many negations of basic human rights. The execution of the death penalty is a blow to the self-respect of human beings and fosters violence in society. Having signed international covenants on human rights, the Philippines has an ethical obligation not only to respect life but to protect it as well. It is also noted that in capital punishment cases, the victims are often from disadvantaged communities who do not have proper representation. This systemic discrimination further negates the basic premise of the rule of law, equal justice for all, and also furthers social divides.</p>
  
      <p>There is no reasoning that can help rationalize the death penalty in the Philippines now or any other time in the near future. Studies have shown that it doesn’t prevent crime, it puts the totally innocent at the risk of even being executed, and almost surely aims to take forward the violation of the accused’s basic human rights. There are many other far more humane ways if there are reasons to re-evaluate the standing policies on crime in the country. It is a curse to society and with every use remains proof that society must not be blinded to an eye for an eye; pardon is the only way to move forward to remove the crime from society. That applies everywhere including the Philippines.</p>
  
      <p>The pain that such countries face in having crime are structural errors that have to be looked at holistically. Solutions that lessen the graph lines of waiting for trials and achieving balance during the ruling would prove to grow the economy along with the education system.</p>
