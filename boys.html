      <p><strong>PRO: The Healthcare System in the Philippines Lacks Sufficient Resources and Funding in Public Healthcare</strong></p>
      <p>The healthcare system, like any other, is designed to serve the interests of individuals, and in this case, the citizens of the Philippines. Nonetheless, for a long time, this organism has been ineffective in responding to public requirements, owing to inadequate and limited facilities within its boundaries.</p>
      <p><strong>Healthcare Institutions with a Strong Public Sector:</strong> Hospitals, polyclinics, and other state-funded medical institutions dominate the healthcare landscape in the Philippines. However, the proposed financial allotment is very limited and struggles to meet the increasing demand for medical facilities, the number of practitioners, and administrative support staff.</p>
      <p>Immediately tackling the considerable vector of the aggravating healthcare challenge of the country, which is underfunded and has a considerable number of public hospitals that most often do not have sufficient instruments to serve the citizens.</p>
      <p>While such programs are described as radical, they reveal serious shortcomings as the UHC Act presents a great reformation but in most circumstances focuses the healthcare system of the Philippines around one binding goal without tackling the embedded structural weaknesses. This, in turn, runs the risk of ignoring the distinctive and focused requirements of so many communities and therefore, the chances of the success of the program in providing balanced and all-rounded health care are undermined.</p>
      <p><strong>Supporting Claims of the Counterclaim:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The provision of health insurance to the Philippines beneficiaries is an automatic feature because of the UHC Act.</li>
        <li>There are emerging health programs that in the near future will boost the provision of healthcare by bringing the healthcare service to the people in their neglected regions.</li>
        <li>Contributions from the private sector have also provided further assistance to medical facilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although the UHC Act and other programs can be considered progress in the right direction, they do not provide a solution to the problems of chronic underfunding and scarcity of resources. The sluggish pace of the rollout of these initiatives has left the clinical staff of public hospitals overworked and under-resourced. The situation does not improve due to poor government investment in the healthcare sector, and poor allocation of resources.</p>
      <p>Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) data reveals there is a critical shortage of medical supplies and healthcare workers in numerous public hospitals. According to the reports made by the World Bank, healthcare spending in the Philippines is one of the lowest in Southeast Asia with an average of only 5 percent of the GDP. Public hospitals being swamped with patients, excessive waiting periods, and making out-of-pocket payments for treatment effectively demonstrate the inadequacies present in the healthcare system.</p>
      <p>The healthcare system in the Philippines is also characterized by a lack of resources due to limited finances, which results in poor access to quality medical care. These obstacles can be overcome only through increased government spending, better distribution of the available resources, and institutional reforms.</p>
      <p><strong>Providing an Action Plan:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Devote larger portions of the gross domestic product (GDP) to healthcare organizations.</li>
        <li>Use programs of health professionals' recruitment, training, and retention policies.</li>
        <li>Conduct sensitization campaigns on the need to improve the availability of health facilities, especially in the rural and marginalized regions.</li>
        <li>Collaborate with external agencies for funding and expertise.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>PRO:should e sport be a real sport</strong></p>

      <p>Before I start my statement, I am going to explain what E-sports is. <strong>Esports</strong>, short term for <strong>electronic sports</strong>, is a form of competition using video games. Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video games competitions, particularly between professional players, played individually or as teams.</p>
  
      <p>E-sports' status as a "real sport" has become a hot topic of discussion over time. With millions of players and supporters worldwide, competitive gaming has grown quickly, making e-sports a sensation rather than a niche pastime. Although many believe that e-sports cannot be considered sports because they do not involve physical exercise, this is not the case because e-sports are extremely similar to other sports in terms of skill, discipline, and strategic depth. Given its competitive structure, necessary skill set, and cultural influence, this article thinks e-sports do indeed qualify as legitimate sports.</p>
  
      <p>Esports are held by strict rules, rankings, and other professional standards comparable to traditional sports. Worldwide events such as <strong>DOTA 2</strong>, <strong>League of Legends</strong>, and <strong>Valorant</strong> have professional features. These tournaments demand intense preparation, strategic planning, and execution, akin to competitions in chess, tennis, or even football.</p>
  
      <p>Professional E-sports players are committed to their practice, often practicing for over a few hours. The training includes improvements of reaction skills, mastering their strategies, and analyzing the opponents.</p>
  
      <p>Some contend that e-sports are not legitimate sports because they don't require physical effort. But as the <strong>International Olympic Committee</strong> has officially acknowledged chess, physicality is not the only requirement for validity. Additionally, e-sport participants deal with physical difficulties like repetitive strain injuries and the requirement for quick reflexes.</p>
  
      <p>Another criticism is that video games are "just entertainment." However, this viewpoint downplays the commitment and skill needed to be successful in e-sports. E-sports have changed similarly to traditional sports, which have progressed from amateur pastimes to professional sports.</p>

      <p><strong>PRO:Supporting Jeepney Phaseout</strong></p>
      <p>
        The jeepney phaseout in the Philippines is a necessary step towards modernizing the public transportation system. Controversy has started, particularly among drivers and conductors, but the benefits far exceed the challenges. The phaseout comes with the goals of sustainability, public safety, and economic modernization, which are necessary for national progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeeps have long been a part of Filipino culture and transport. However, many jeeps of today are outdated, inefficient, and environmentally harmful. The Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP) has goals to replace traditional jeepneys with safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly vehicles. Critics argue that the phaseout may displace drivers and conductors who cannot afford the new jeeps, but proper government intervention and subsidies can act on these concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditional jeeps rely on old engines that emit many amounts of carbon dioxide and pollutants, contributing to air pollution and health issues in urban areas. Modernized vehicles use cleaner technology, such as compliant engines or electric motors, which reduce gas emissions. Supporting the action of the jeepney phaseout is a step toward achieving climate goals and improving air quality for all Filipinos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many traditional jeepneys are decades old and lack proper safety features, exposing passengers to risks of accidents. The phaseout introduces modern vehicles with improved safety standards, such as better brake systems, GPS tracking, and CCTV cameras. Additionally, the new jeeps offer greater comfort for passengers, including air conditioning and more open space.
      </p>
  
      <h4><strong>1.) Environmental Sustainability</strong></h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Opinion:</strong> Transferring to cleaner technology aligns with the environmental goals and improves public health.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Support:</strong> Studies show that transportation contributes 69% of air pollution in Metro Manila, with modern jeeps reducing emissions by up to 90%.
      </p>
  
      <h4><strong>2.) Public Safety and Comfort</strong></h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Opinion:</strong> Upgrading to modern jeeps ensures a safer and more reliable public transportation system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Support:</strong> The UP-NCTS identified safety risks in old jeeps due to mechanical failures. Modernized jeeps include features like anti-lock brakes, GPS tracking, and CCTV, which enhance passenger security.
      </p>
  
      <h4><strong>3.) Economic Efficiency and Government Support</strong></h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Opinion:</strong> With proper support, modernization can boost conductors’ income and the overall efficiency of the transport sector.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Support:</strong> The Department of Transportation (DOTr) found modernized vehicles to be 30-50% more fuel-efficient, with drivers saving PHP 500-800 daily on operating costs. Additionally, the government provides subsidies of up to PHP 160,000 per unit to help the transition.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        While the initial cost of modernization seems high, it provides opportunities for economic growth in the long term. The program can enhance the automotive manufacturing and electric vehicle industries, creating jobs and encouraging technological advancements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, modernized vehicles are more fuel-efficient, reducing operation costs for drivers and providing more reliable service for passengers.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address the concerns of drivers and conductors, the government has proposed financial assistance programs, such as subsidies, loans, and cooperatives. These mechanisms aim to make the transition easier and inclusive, ensuring that small operators are not left behind. The phaseout is not about eliminating livelihoods but about transitioning to a more sustainable and equitable transportation system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>In conclusion</strong>, the jeepney phaseout is a necessary action that addresses pressing issues of environmental impact, public safety, and economic inefficiency. By embracing modernization, the Philippines can build a transportation system that upholds the values of sustainability and progress. While challenges remain, they can be overcome with strong government support and the active participation of manufacturers. Supporting the jeepney phaseout is supporting a brighter, cleaner, and safer future for all Filipinos.

      <p><strong>PRO: Banning Sport Hunting in all nations</strong></p>
      <p>Sport hunting, defined as the recreational killing of animals for trophies or entertainment, inflicts harm on ecosystems, animal welfare, and ethical standards. This paper supports the ban on sport hunting and emphasizes its cruelty and environmental damage.</p>
  
      <p>Sport hunting is a long-standing practice often regulated through permits and quotas. However, it perpetuates unnecessary violence against animals and disrupts ecological balance.</p>
  
      <p>Banning sport hunting is essential to uphold ethical values and protect biodiversity.</p>
  
      <p>Sport hunting should be banned because it is unethical and violates animal rights. It involves the intentional killing of animals solely for entertainment and profit, which ultimately leads to biodiversity loss.</p>
  
      <p>Banning sport hunting globally could affect regions where it serves as a primary source of income and funding. Additionally, some argue that sport hunting helps control overpopulation and habitat destruction, contributing to maintaining ecological balance.</p>
  
      <p>While it is true that sport hunting provides income for some regions and helps manage overpopulation, we must prioritize the issue of animal rights violations. Intentionally killing animals for profit is unethical. There are alternative ways to generate income that do not involve harming animals, allowing us to preserve wildlife and promote sustainable practices.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>Assertion 1: Sport hunting disrupts ecosystems</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Targeting large mammals and apex predators disrupts ecosystems, as these species play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Damaging key species disrupts the food chain, leading to overpopulation of other species and destruction of habitats.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>Assertion 2: Sport hunting endangers species</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Overhunting pushes endangered species closer to extinction.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has identified sport hunting as a contributing factor to the extinction of species.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>Assertion 3: Ethical conservation alternatives are more effective</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Eco-tourism and wildlife photography provide sustainable, long-term income sources without harming animals.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Countries like Kenya have banned sport hunting and transitioned to eco-tourism, resulting in long-term ecological and economic benefits.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Restating the Argument:</strong> Banning sport hunting is a crucial decision for preserving biodiversity and promoting the ethical treatment of animals. Its harmful impacts on ecosystems, endangered species, and social values far outweigh its purported benefits.</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Governments should implement nationwide bans on sport hunting while transitioning toward eco-tourism and community conservation initiatives.</li>
        <li>Additionally, public education campaigns should be conducted to raise awareness about the importance of wildlife conservation.</li>

      <p><strong>PRO: Animal testing should be banned for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other products.</strong></p>
      <p>Animal testing for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other products is both cruel and unnecessary. It inflicts pain and suffering on countless animals, and there are viable alternatives available that are more effective and humane. The practice is outdated, and advancements in technology have made animal testing largely redundant. It is important to acknowledge the ethical responsibility of finding better alternatives that do not involve animals. These methods are more accurate in terms of predicting human reactions, and they also help save lives, reduce waste, and prevent environmental damage caused by disposing of lab animals.</p>
      
      <h4><strong>Counterclaim</strong></h4>
      <p>Some experts argue that animal testing is necessary for ensuring product safety and that no fully reliable alternatives exist. They claim that replacing animal testing would slow down scientific progress, and it might take over a hundred years before regulatory animal experiments are fully substituted. Animal testing is said to ensure human safety by identifying potential risks of products, allowing scientists to control confounding factors, and contributing to life-saving cures and treatments.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>Refuting the Counterclaim</strong></h4>
      <p>While these concerns emphasize human safety, they overlook key issues. First, animals and humans are biologically different; 92% of drugs fail in human clinical trials despite appearing safe in animal tests. Second, imprecise results from animal testing often lead to clinical trials with harmful or faulty substances, exposing humans to unnecessary risks. Furthermore, many countries such as the European Union, Australia, and the U.K. have already implemented alternative testing methods, demonstrating their safety and effectiveness without animal involvement.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>The Argument</strong></h4>
      
      <p><strong>Assertion of the Claim #1:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Animal testing is unjustifiable and inhumane, as animals have a right to life.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Replacing animal subjects with alternatives minimizes harm to animals and humans alike.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flexibility: Using alternatives reduces animal harm and allows for more ethical research methods.</li>
        <li>Accessibility: Animals, like rodents, are often subjected to experimentation, but using alternatives can free them from such exploitation.</li>
        <li>Research: Animal testing has shown that experiments can be excruciatingly painful, causing illness or death.</li>
        <li>Technological Integration: Alternatives like in vitro testing offer better opportunities to reduce animal testing.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p><strong>Assertion of the Claim #2:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Animal testing is scientifically outdated, and more effective alternatives exist.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Modern alternatives are technologically advanced and provide more humane and accurate data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flexibility: New technologies adapt more quickly than animal testing, yielding more precise results without animal discomfort.</li>
        <li>Accessibility: Many alternative methods are becoming affordable and widely available, making them more reliable than animal testing.</li>
        <li>Research: Technologies like 3D bioprinting, microfluidic chips, and artificial human skin have been proven to provide better outcomes than animal testing.</li>
        <li>Technological Integration: New research methods are continually improving, leading to smoother development processes than traditional animal testing.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p><strong>Assertion of the Claim #3:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Banning animal testing will reduce environmental harm.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Eliminating animal testing can prevent the pollution caused by disposing of animals used in experiments, thus preserving biodiversity and public health.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flexibility: Banning animal testing helps protect biodiversity by preventing species extinction caused by overuse in experiments.</li>
        <li>Accessibility: Reducing the use of animals lowers the environmental pollution caused by their disposal, benefiting both animals and humans.</li>
        <li>Research: Animal experiments are expensive and time-consuming, often yielding harmful outcomes rather than beneficial ones.</li>
        <li>Technological Integration: Public awareness and technological advancements can reduce the negative impacts of animal testing on the environment and society.</li>

      <p><strong>CON: Two Child Policy per household</strong>/p>
      <p>As you all know, the growth in population is a serious problem in some nations. People are very stressed on assets like food, water, and energy. As a response to this big problem, countries implement two-child policy. It means that families can no longer have more than two children in their household. Through this rule, population is easy to manage and it gives better life to everyone. Poverty is prevented because resources are shared better and it can protect the environment.</p>
  
      <p>Although many people think that it is unfair, people said that it can take the freedom away to have many children that they can decide of. People are also worrying because this rule may cause problems like having too many old people than teenagers. Many people argue that government should focus more on giving education and giving jobs instead of limiting the number of children. Giving education to children and giving jobs to families can improve our economy and prevent poverty.</p>
  
      <p>While it is important to respect the freedom of people, the two-child policy’s benefits are significant. We need to control the growth of population quickly, and education and job creation also take too long. Combining programs that support the care for the elderly and motives for families that are small can help manage the resources and protect the environment. This solution can solve issues while still respecting the people’s rights.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>Assertion: The Two-Child Policy is necessary for managing resources</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> The two-child policy helps manage resources better.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>It ensures food, water, and energy are distributed fairly.</li>
        <li>It prevents poverty by giving better management of resources.</li>
        <li>It prevents environmental problems by managing the growth of population.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4><strong>Assertion: The Two-Child Policy Helps Prevent Overpopulation Issues</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Limiting families to two children prevents overpopulation problems.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>It reduces overcrowding in cities and strain on public services.</li>
        <li>Parents can provide better care and education for fewer children.</li>
        <li>It balances job availability with the number of job seekers, reducing unemployment.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4><strong>Assertion: The Two-Child Policy Can Address Social Concerns</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> The two-child policy can be adapted to address social issues.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>It can include exceptions to avoid gender imbalances and aging population problems.</li>
        <li>Support programs can be added to promote gender equality and elder care.</li>
        <li>Incentives can encourage compliance while respecting individual choices.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4><strong>Action Plans:</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Public Awareness Campaign: Launch media campaigns, community meetings, and distribute materials to educate the public on the policy's benefits.</li>
        <li>Supportive Measures for Compliance: Provide financial incentives, free healthcare, and education for families adhering to the policy.</li>
        <li>Exception Management System: Establish a transparent process for granting exceptions and regularly review exception cases.</li>
        <li>Monitoring and Evaluation: Set up a dedicated body to oversee the policy, conduct regular surveys, and adjust the policy based on data.</li>
        <li>Complementary Social Programs: Promote gender equality, create elder care programs, and implement vocational training and job creation initiatives.</li>

      <p><strong>PRO: Disable nuclear powerplant</strong></p>
      <p>The world we live in is overshadowed by the threat of nuclear weapons. On one hand, they are considered by some as the ultimate peacekeepers, but on the other, they have the potential to wipe out humanity in an instant. The question is: do we really need them?</p>
      
      <p>
        Nuclear weapons are the most dangerous weapons on earth. One can destroy a whole city, potentially killing millions, and jeopardizing the natural environment and lives of future generations through its long-term catastrophic effects. The dangers from such weapons arise from their very existence. Although nuclear weapons have only been used twice in warfare—in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945—about 13,400 reportedly remain in our world today, and there have been over 2,000 nuclear tests conducted to date. Disarmament is the best protection against such dangers, but achieving this goal has been a tremendously difficult challenge.
      </p>
  
      <h4><strong>Counterclaim</strong></h4>
      <p>
        Some people argue that nuclear weapons are necessary for maintaining peace. They claim that the fear of mutual destruction keeps countries from going to war.
      </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Nuclear weapons prevented large-scale wars, like another world war, after World War II.</li>
        <li>Countries with nuclear weapons argue that these arsenals ensure their security.</li>
        <li>Without nuclear weapons, rogue nations might feel emboldened to act aggressively.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4><strong>Refuting the Counterclaim</strong></h4>
      <p>
        I understand where this perspective comes from, but I strongly disagree. The idea of peace through fear is deeply flawed. What if a mistake happens? What if someone presses the wrong button? We’ve come close to disaster in the past. Relying on something so dangerous for peace is like playing with fire.
      </p>
  
      <h4><strong>Evidence for the Argument</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Studies show the catastrophic consequences of even a small nuclear war, which could cause global famine due to climate effects.</li>
        <li>The cost of maintaining nuclear weapons is enormous. Those billions could be used for healthcare, education, or addressing climate change.</li>
        <li>There's always the risk of these weapons falling into the wrong hands, such as terrorists or rogue actors.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4><strong>The Argument</strong></h4>
  
      <p><strong>Assertion of the Claim 1</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Nuclear weapons are too dangerous to exist.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> A single mistake or intentional strike could cause irreversible damage. Think about the innocent lives lost in Japan—do we want to risk that happening again on a larger scale?</p>
  
      <p><strong>Assertion of the Claim 2</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> We don’t need nuclear weapons to maintain peace.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Many regions, like Latin America and Africa, are nuclear-free zones and haven’t experienced large-scale wars as a result. Peace comes from diplomacy and cooperation.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Assertion of the Claim 3</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Disarmament is possible with strong international cooperation.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Treaties like the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) have worked before. If countries genuinely commit to disarmament, we can create a safer world.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
      <p>
        The existence of nuclear weapons is a gamble with humanity's future. While some argue they prevent war, the risks far outweigh any perceived benefits. Disabling nuclear weapons is not just a choice—it’s a necessity for the survival of our planet.
      </p>
  
      <p><strong>Providing an Action Plan</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Countries should work together to strengthen and expand nuclear disarmament treaties.</li>
        <li>Redirect the funds used for nuclear programs toward solving global issues like poverty and climate change.</li>
        <li>Educate people about the dangers of nuclear weapons to build public support for disarmament.</li>

      <p><strong>PRO: Duterte's War on Drugs</strong></p>
      <p>Duterte's War on Drugs, which started in 2016, was in response to the alarming rate of drug abuse and crime in the Philippines. The administration of President Duterte took a hard stance on the war against drugs, focusing on eliminating drug cartels and reducing drug-related crime in the country. The war has been controversial, with many accusing the government of human rights violations, particularly the extrajudicial killings of suspected drug offenders. It however was launched to protect the Filipino population, to eliminate increased crime rates, and suppress this drug abuse that has brought communities down.</p>
  
      <h4>Counterclaim:</h4>
      <p>The opposition argues that Duterte's War on Drugs violates human rights, with allegations of extrajudicial killings and targeting individuals without proper legal procedures. Critics believe that the campaign while aiming to eliminate drug-related crime, has caused significant harm to the community, especially the marginalized, and undermines the rule of law.</p>

      <p>1. Human Rights Violations: Several human rights reports have noted the killing of suspects without being afforded due process, not to mention the impunity for law enforcement.</p>
      <p>2. Poor Targeting: It is also said that it is the poor who suffer most, with a tendency for the police to victimize the poor and, more importantly, already vulnerable ones.</p>
      <p>3. Undermining of the Rule of Law: Critics argue that by tolerating killings without trials, the campaign weakens judicial institutions and erodes trust in law enforcement.</p>
  
      <p>Despite such grave human rights concerns, Duterte's War on Drugs mainly aims to protect the populace from the widespread proliferation of illicit drugs that destroy and deviate families and families' very social structures. Even then, the government has recognized steps in dealing with some human rights issues - putting in place oversight procedures for police operations and stronger advocacy for accountability within its ranks.</p>
  
      <h4>Supporting Claims:</h4>
      <p>1. Decrease in Crime: Research indicates that drug-related crimes have decreased since the beginning of the War on Drugs. Statistics indicate that cities with a high rate of drug crime have experienced a decline in violent crimes.</p>
      <p>2. Support for Law Enforcement: Surveys indicate that most citizens support the campaign, believing it is necessary to protect communities from the dangers posed by drug addiction and trafficking.</p>
      <p>3. International Recognition: Apart from criticisms, various international bodies have recognized Duterte's tough approach to drugs and its benefits for public safety.</p>
  
      <h4>Suggested Solution:</h4>
      <p>The government could further improve the effectiveness of the War on Drugs while alleviating human rights concerns if it were to adopt a more holistic approach by focusing more on rehabilitation instead of punishment. More rehabilitation centers and programs for drug users must be established, any form of extrajudicial killings should be thoroughly investigated, and more support is needed to be given to law enforcement officers to uphold due process. This might make the War on Drugs a balanced and sustainable operation that could maintain public safety without sacrificing human rights toward a healthier and safer society.</p>

      <p><strong>PRO: illegalization of abortion in the Philippines</strong></p>
      <p>This position paper supports the continued illegalization of abortion in the Philippines, arguing that it prioritizes the protection of unborn children and the cultural values of Filipino society.</p>
  
      <p>Abortion in the Philippines is strictly prohibited due to religious beliefs, posing a significant risk to the mother's life, despite the country's strong religious influence.</p>
  
      <p>Abortion should remain illegal in the Philippines because it supports moral principles and protects the rights of unborn children.</p>
  
      <p>Legalizing abortion in the Philippines is argued to protect women's autonomy, especially in cases of rape or health risks, while highlighting the dangers of unsafe abortions.</p>
  
      <p>Illegalizing abortion doesn't equate to denying women's rights; it should focus on providing better support systems, including comprehensive healthcare and counseling, to prevent pressure and uphold moral and ethical values, such as protecting life from conception.</p>
  
      <p>Studies show that countries with strict anti-abortion laws often have lower rates of abortion-related deaths when women have access to proper healthcare and support systems.</p>
  
      <h4>Opinion:</h4>
      <p>Illegalizing abortion upholds the sanctity of life, which is a fundamental value in our society.</p>
  
      <h4>Support:</h4>
      <p>The Philippines is a predominantly Catholic country, where the belief in the sanctity of life from conception is a deeply held cultural value.</p>
  
      <h4>Opinion:</h4>
      <p>The illegalization of abortion encourages the development of better healthcare and social support systems for women.</p>
  
      <h4>Support:</h4>
      <p>Instead of focusing on abortion, resources can be redirected toward improving maternal healthcare, providing counseling services, and increasing access to contraceptives.</p>
  
      <h4>Opinion:</h4>
      <p>Legalizing abortion is unnecessary and does not resolve the issues of poverty and social inequality faced by women.</p>
  
      <h4>Support:</h4>
      <p>Lack of resources and poverty are linked to many of the circumstances that push women to seek abortions.</p>
  
      <p>The Philippines should continue to illegalize abortion to protect life, promote women's health, and address unwanted pregnancies, but legalizing it is not the solution.</p>
  
      <p>To reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion, the Philippines should focus on improving access to sexual health education and healthcare.</p>

      <p><strong>CON: The removal of the ROTC Program from Basic-ED</strong></p>
      <p>The ROTC, or Reserved Officer Training Corps is a college-based program aimed at providing a college degree as well as training to become a commissioned officer in the Philippine Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marines.</p>
  
      <p>Because of the murder of a college student named Mark Welson Chua from the University of Santo Tomas back in 2002, the ROTC program was abolished, because he exposed the corruption within the ROTC program, not only that, but the program was also inefficient, as many graduates did not pursue any military careers, and with the lack of accountability, no one was entirely responsible for the abuse and corruption in the program, a lack of transparency.</p>
  
      <h4>Thesis Statement:</h4>
      <p>This paper will show why the ROTC program should not be abolished, even though the program had some history of corruption and abuse, and as to why it should be reinstated with many significant changes and reforms.</p>
  
      <h4>The Claim:</h4>
      <p>“ROTC should be removed, and it will stay that way due to the existing corruption and abuse within the program it had before.”</p>
  
      <h4>The Counterclaim:</h4>
      <p>“The ROTC program should be reinstated as mandatory with many significant reforms and changes to the program and to account for everyone who is involved to avoid unnecessary abuse and corruption within the program.”</p>
  
      <h4>Refutation of Counterclaim:</h4>
      <p>“Whilst it's undeniable the ROTC program had its fair share of controversies, we have to admit that the many benefits and opportunities it could give, with the reforms and changes to the program and for the people who manage it – is accountable for their responsibilities to the program, the ROTC can be a very helpful tool for developing future leaders and its goal of producing great leaders.</p>
  
      <p>Not only that, but the program offers benefits such as leadership training for cadets, scholarships, and career opportunities in the military. This program can really help them develop the necessary skills for leadership and discipline.”</p>
  
      <h4>Argument 1: ROTC promotes leadership and discipline.</h4>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong><br>
      By introducing discipline and leadership skills, ROTC can help individuals nurture their leadership skills and discipline which is needed in many fields, especially in the military.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Support:</strong><br>
      Since it is of military nature, it’ll often involve rigorous training and leadership activities/exercises, and help cadets develop their leadership skills as well as discipline, responsibility, and perseverance.</p>
  
      <p>It also gives real-world experience since it provides many opportunities to do so, by enhancing their problem-solving and critical thinking skills from real-world scenarios.</p>
  
      <h4>Argument 2: ROTC promotes patriotism and civic engagement.</h4>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong><br>
      By promoting patriotism and civic engagement, the ROTC program can help to build a stronger and more connected society.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Support:</strong><br>
      ROTC cadets with their patriotism are willing to serve their country and people. Many graduates go on to serve in the Army or other national agencies.</p>
  
      <p>The program often encourages young cadets to do community service and volunteering, giving a sense of responsibility.</p>
  
      <h4>Argument 3: The ROTC program offers many benefits and opportunities.</h4>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong><br>
      There are scholarships offered within the program, giving many young individuals the support they need in their lives.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Support:</strong><br>
      The ROTC program gives scholarships to those who join. This is for those who want to pursue higher education but cannot do so due to their financial situation.</p>
  
      <p>If the ROTC program is properly reinstated it will offer many significant benefits to the populace for both individuals and the general people by promoting leadership, discipline, and patriotism. This program will help young people with the skills necessary for their future.</p>
  
      <p>Everyone should be held accountable for their actions. The ROTC program was not maintained properly, and due to that, it got abolished. We should reinstate the program to support the people and the country and make sure the program does not fall into corruption – taking steps to make sure everyone is held accountable with their responsibilities so we could prevent future incidents from happening and to ensure that the program benefits the people and the country.</p>

      <p><strong>PRO: Removal on K-12 ED</strong></p>
      <p>K-12 education, implemented in many countries, extends the traditional educational system to include kindergarten and an additional two years of senior high school. While it aims to better prepare students for higher education, employment, and global competitiveness, the system has faced criticism due to its financial burden and questions about its effectiveness. With a focus on competency-based learning, the K–12 program was created to bring local educational systems into line with international norms. But in many nations, the financial burden on families, the extra years of education, and the lack of post-graduation employment options have caused serious worries.</p>
  
      <p>This essay makes the case that eliminating K–12 education would help students, families, and society as a whole by easing financial burdens, expediting the educational process, and resolving demands from the labor market.</p>
  
      <p>This essay argues that by reducing financial constraints, accelerating the educational process, and addressing job market demands, doing away with K–12 schooling would benefit students, families, and society at large.</p>
  
      <h4>Supporting Claims of the Counterclaim</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>With programs like STEM, technical-vocational, and arts, K–12 education gives pupils specialized skills.</li>
        <li>It lowers dropout rates by filling in the gaps between secondary school and college.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>Refuting the Counterclaim</h4>
      <p>While K-12 education introduces specialized tracks, it often fails to provide meaningful employment opportunities for senior high school graduates. Many still pursue higher education to secure stable jobs, making the additional years redundant for most students.</p>
  
      <h4>Giving Evidence for the Argument</h4>
      <p>According to a research by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, senior high school graduates have trouble finding work because they are thought to be unprepared and because their qualifications are not much different from those of regular high school graduates and K–12 graduates.</p>
  
      <h4>The Argument</h4>
      <h5>A. Assertion of the Claim #1</h5>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Removing K-12 education reduces the financial burden on families.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>The additional two years in K-12 education increase tuition, transportation, and living expenses, particularly for low-income families.</li>
          <li>By reverting to a shorter educational cycle, families can allocate resources to other essential needs or higher education opportunities.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
  
      <h5>B. Assertion of the Claim #2</h5>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Streamlining the education process enables students to enter the workforce earlier.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Many students in countries with a non-K-12 system have successfully joined the workforce at an earlier age, contributing to economic productivity.</li>
          <li>By completing education faster, students can gain practical experience and begin earning income sooner, which benefits both individuals and society.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
  
      <h5>C. Assertion of the Claim #3</h5>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Addressing mismatches in labor market demands requires focused vocational and tertiary education rather than extended secondary education.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Industries often require specialized skills that can be better developed in vocational schools or on-the-job training rather than through generalized senior high school tracks.</li>
          <li>Countries with shorter educational cycles and strong vocational training programs, such as Germany, achieve higher employment rates and workforce efficiency.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
  
      <p>Removing K-12 education eliminates unnecessary financial and time burdens, streamlines the educational process, and creates a more direct pathway for students to pursue meaningful careers.</p>
  
      <h4>B. Providing an Action Plan</h4>
      <p>Policymakers should phase out the K-12 system and reinvest resources into enhancing basic education and vocational programs. Strengthening college preparatory programs and creating accessible skill-based training will ensure students are well-equipped for their future careers without the prolonged years of schooling.</p>

      <p><strong>PRO: Banning all mobile phones in School</strong></p>
      <p>Mobile devices have become an essential part of our lives in recent years. Mobile devices offer us useful tools for getting information, communication, and educational apps. However, this also concerns the rising usage of mobile devices in school have increasing concerns about the impact on a student’s academic, social skills, and overall well-being. In comparison, some argue that using mobile devices should be used less in school, or banning them outright. This is a concerning issue for the future of these students and must be immediately looked into.</p>
  
      <p>Mobile devices are useful tools nowadays. They can help you search for information faster or communicate with someone far away, which is also a disadvantage in school. School is a place to gain knowledge and test your capabilities, and mobile devices distract students in class. Another problem with mobile devices is that they depend on their phones and do not improve their critical thinking.</p>
  
      <p>Although mobile devices can enhance educational opportunities and improve communication, they also pose risks such as distracting students, contributing to mental health issues, and hindering social development. Therefore, schools need to consider implementing strict regulations or bans on mobile phone use during school hours.</p>
  
      <h4>Better Academic Performance</h4>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong><br>
      This would increase the student's academic performance and improve their critical thinking.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Support:</strong><br>
      Studies show that banning mobile devices increases by 6.4% to their original grade in England, and in Spain, banning mobile devices has been shown to increase in math and science.</p>
  
      <h4>Reduction of Cyberbullying</h4>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong><br>
      Reducing Cyberbullying would help students interact with each other more and wouldn’t make them feel discriminated against.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Support:</strong><br>
      The study shows that there are people who bully people through the internet and harass them can make the students’ mental health worse.</p>
  
      <h4>Avoid Addiction</h4>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong><br>
      The students use their phones most of the time and don’t listen to their teacher or are not aware of their surroundings, which could cause them anxiety or hinder themselves from social interaction.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Support:</strong><br>
      According to Schneide, using phones can lead to addiction and anxiety that hinders social interaction and personal development.</p>
  
      <p>Although phones are a useful tool for students, they also have some disadvantages like becoming too dependent on their phones and how mobile devices can hinder a person’s social life. The school should put a very strict rule for using cellphones in class.</p>

      <p><strong>CON: Legalizing Divorce in the Philippines</strong></p>
      <p>As a mainly Catholic country, the Philippines should continue to oppose divorce to preserve the sacredness of marriage and protect family welfare.</p>
  
      <p>Although maintaining a traditional value is essential for a country with a population of Catholic citizens, it is also important to recognize the real reason for even partaking in marriages. Refusing married couples the ability to legally end unsuccessful marriages may result in high probabilities of domestic violence and societal problems. A more reliable solution would be encouraging married couples to choose counseling instead of separating.</p>
  
      <p>One of the few nations in the world where divorce is not legally recognized is the Philippines. It realistically implies that married couples cooped up on intending to end their marriage are getting to choose between legal separation or annulment as an alternative option for divorce. Of course, there has been quite a lot of discussion about divorce in the recent years. Although there are some reasons on legalizing divorce, this position paper argues that preserving our country's Catholic belief, which not fully recognize divorce, is of topmost priority as it serves as a preservation for the value of marriage and the well-being of families.</p>
  
      <h5>Claim:</h5>
      <p>“We should not legalize divorce in the Philippines as it is a mainly Catholic country”</p>
  
      <h5>Counterclaim:</h5>
      <p>“We should legalize divorce as it will help uphold gender equality and individual rights”</p>
  
      <h5>Refutation of Counterclaim:</h5>
      <p>“While legalizing divorce may seem like a stepping stone for gender equality and individual rights, it’s important to consider possible consequences. A not strongly supported divorce law could lead to drastic domestic abuse against women. Moreover, considering the religious belief of the country as it is a mostly Catholic country, it can weaken the essential foundation of the country itself.”</p>
  
      <h4>Assertion #1</h4>
      <p><strong>"Bearing in mind the religious value of the country"</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> The Philippines should not encourage and allow divorce as it can weaken the importance of marriage, which has a significant aspect of the country's Catholic belief and may result in a significant increase in separated families.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Furthermore, in some studies conducted in nations in which divorce is legal, it frequently indicated an increase in family separations, affecting the emotional and psychological well-being of children. If the country protects its cultural identity, it will promote families by supporting them.</p>
  
      <h4>Assertion #2</h4>
      <p><strong>"A significant piece in the society which is family"</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> One of the significant pieces in our society is family, especially those who have children, would suffer significantly from divorce. As it may result in behavioral issues, emotional trauma, and difficulties with learning. We can ensure family stability and well-being by maintaining the value of marriage.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> For some cases, as how our society is struggling from poverty, couples partaking in divorce can increase the risk of influencing unmarried couples to choose staying unmarried on behalf of the challenges they are facing such as poverty.</p>
  
      <h4>Assertion #3</h4>
      <p><strong>"Inexpensive counseling option for married couples"</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Offering inexpensive counseling assistance for couples in resolving their problems with each other. Providing this program which offers families, particularly those that are dealing with difficulties on assistance and guidance for their problem with each other.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Divorce may somewhat be like a solution for certain situations, but it is important that married couples should consider our society. Legalizing divorce would have a bad impact on society as a whole and ruin the foundation of the family. In a society which often prioritizes individualism above family, the Philippines can maintain its position as a symbol of hope and stability by rejecting the idea of divorce and advocating for strong family values.</p>
  
      <h5>Restating the Argument:</h5>
      <p>The Philippines, a Catholic nation, has long held a great stance against divorce. While the availability of divorce as a marriage couple has been not encouraged as it is crucial to recognize the realities of bearing a family. Forcing married couples to remain in abusive marriages can lead to significant emotional and psychological distress.</p>
      <p>Instead of bearing a strict prohibition on divorce, a more compassionate approach would be to prioritize marriage counseling. By providing couples the support on addressing the issues, we can strengthen marriages and can reduce the need for divorce.</p>
  
      <h5>Providing an Action Plan:</h5>
      <p>Promote Marriage Counseling: Implementing this approach, the government should invest in counseling and promote public awareness for the other marriage couples. As religious organizations can also play a big role in encouraging couples to seek help.</p>
      <p>Provide Support for Separated and Divorced Individuals: Lastly, a balanced approach on combining values and traditions is essential. By giving support to struggling couples and strengthening the family, we can make a society that can value both religious belief and marriage and even the well-being of individuals.</p>

        <li>Puts a heavy cost on families, particularly those with smaller incomes.</li>
        <li>Discourages students from pursuing passions outside of the standardized academic framework.</li>

      <h3>Refutation of Counterclaim:</h3>
      <ul>

        <li>Supporters include expanding educational options, giving underprivileged schools more money, and creating programs that develop a range of skills.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>B. Assertion of the Claim #2</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A major challenge facing our K-12 education system is the uneven distribution of resources. Schools with limited funding struggle to provide essential tools for learning, hire qualified teachers, and offer enriching extracurricular activities.</li>
        <li>This inequality can hold students back, especially those from low-salary communities. To ensure that every child has the opportunity to succeed, we must work to bridge these resource gaps and provide equal access to quality education.</li>

      <p><strong>CON: Same-sex marriage in the Philippines</strong></p>
      <p>Same-sex marriage is a controversial topic that has sparked debates across the globe, including the Philippines. While some argue that it promotes equality and inclusivity, others believe it challenges traditional values and societal norms.</p>
  
      <p>The Philippines, as a predominantly Christian country, has deep cultural and religious traditions that define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Despite global trends toward legalizing same-sex marriage, the country continues to grapple with whether to embrace or reject this concept.</p>
  
      <p>This paper argues against the legalization of same-sex marriage in the Philippines due to its potential to disrupt traditional family structures, conflict with religious and cultural values, and create legal complications.</p>
  
  
      <h3>1. THE COUNTERCLAIM</h3>
  
      <h4>A. Summary of the Counterclaim</h4>
      <p>Proponents of same-sex marriage argue that it upholds equality, provides legal protections for LGBTQ+ couples, and strengthens societal inclusivity.</p>
  
      <h4>B. Supporting Claims of the Counterclaim</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Same-sex marriage ensures equal rights for LGBTQ+ individuals.</li>
        <li>It promotes a more inclusive society by recognizing diverse family structures.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>C. Refuting the Counterclaim</h4>
      <p>While these arguments highlight equality and inclusivity, they overlook the potential societal and cultural repercussions. Upholding equality does not necessarily mean redefining long-standing institutions like marriage.</p>
  
      <h4>D. Giving Evidence for the Argument</h4>
      <p>In countries where same-sex marriage has been legalized, traditional family structures have faced challenges, such as disputes over adoption rights and conflicting religious freedoms. Legalizing it in the Philippines may lead to similar conflicts.</p>
  
      <h3>2. THE ARGUMENT</h3>
  
      <h4>A. Assertion of Claim #1</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Opinion:</strong> Same-sex marriage disrupts traditional family values.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> Marriage in the Philippines is rooted in the concept of a union between a man and a woman for procreation and raising children. Allowing same-sex marriage alters this foundation, potentially leading to confusion about familial roles and responsibilities.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>B. Assertion of Claim #2</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Opinion:</strong> Legalizing same-sex marriage goes against religious beliefs.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> The majority of Filipinos adhere to Christian teachings, which define marriage as a sacred union between a man and a woman. Legalizing same-sex marriage would create a conflict between religious practices and state laws, potentially dividing communities.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>C. Assertion of Claim #3</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Opinion:</strong> It could lead to legal and societal complications.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> Legalizing same-sex marriage requires amendments to existing laws on inheritance, adoption, and marital rights. These changes could create confusion and resistance among Filipinos who are not ready to accept such shifts.</li>
      </ul>
  
  
      <h4>A. Restating the Argument</h4>
      <p>The legalization of same-sex marriage in the Philippines is not advisable due to its potential to undermine traditional family values, conflict with religious beliefs, and cause legal complications.</p>
  
      <h4>B. Providing an Action Plan</h4>
      <p>Instead of legalizing same-sex marriage, the government can focus on implementing laws that protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals without redefining marriage. Civil union laws can provide legal recognition and benefits to same-sex couples without disrupting traditional societal structures.</p>

      <h3>Position: PRO </h3>
      <p><strong>Petition for Abolishment of Death Penalty</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Petition of Abolishment for Death Penalties</strong> - The death penalty, also known
         as capital punishment, is the state-sanctioned killing of a person as
         punishment for a crime. The sentence that orders the death penalty is called
         a death sentence, and the act of carrying out the sentence is called an
         execution.</p>
      <p>In light of the ongoing ethical debates and the evolving standards of human rights,
         this petition seeks to abolish the death penalty globally. The rationale 
         for this abolishment is grounded by killings and making it a disadvantage to 
         the conflict it revokes the views of justice, morality, and the essence of
         human rights that result in being unethical and lack of justice on its behalf.</p>
  
      <p><strong>This petition upholds the abolishment of the death penalty, quarrel that it is an injustice and inhumane form of penalizing that risks wrongful executions and undermines the fundamental principles of justice and human dignity.</strong> Death penalty fundamentally violates the principle of the right to life by eliminating a wrongful way of capital punishment by annihilating to the convicted person, we can promote a more equitable and compassionate justice system that prioritizes rehabilitation and respects the sanctity of life rather than executing the felon to unravel the matter.</p>
  
      <p><strong>While this petition argues for the abolishment of the death penalty on the field that it is an unjust and inhumane form of penalizing</strong>, advocates the capital punishment contend that it serves as a necessary tool for achieving justice and maintaining public safety by subduing the convicted person to exterminate its existence to avoid the problem to rise again. They argue that certain crimes, particularly those involving extreme violence or first-degree murder, are so beyond horrific to humans that they warrant the ultimate punishment. To be more coherent, executing the lawbreaker under the demands of law by punishing it through death penalty raises significant ethical and legal questions. This approach to justice aims to serve as a deterrent against severe crimes, reflecting society's commitment to upholding the rule of law.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Hence, this petition seeks to abolish the death sentence as unjust and beyond the grasp of human dignity is futile.</strong> However, defenders say that capital punishment is important for justice and public safety by subduing the culprit, they claim that certain serious acts, particularly extreme violence such as first-degree murder, demand the ultimate punishment of execution. They argue that by executing the death sentence, society sends a clear message about the consequences of serious crimes that they must amend and uphold the rule of law for the sake of humanity not to be downgraded to alter the existence of crimes. By this they proposed justice not only demonstrates society's commitment to upholding the rule of law but also functions as a request against serious crimes, presenting substantial ethical and legal considerations about the role of capital.</p>
  
      <p><strong>While supporters of the death penalty argue that is an essential tool to prevention against violent crime and ensuring public safety by intimidating the fear of execution in potential offenders</strong> as such for the reason that they believe that doing this it discourages individuals from committing serious offenses. They contend that the finality of capital punishment such as execution particularly sends a message to individual about the consequences of attempting to commit any forms rebellious acts against the law scaring each individual from engaging in such activity. In addition to it, it also serves as an advocate by emphasizing society's moral to protect its residents from dangerous criminals lurking, asserting that executing those who commit crime ensures that they cannot deal out harm on innocents again.</p>
  
      <p><strong>While supporters of the death penalty argue that it serves as a necessary tool for achieving justice and maintaining public safety by subduing offender’s existence</strong> to prove the insolent punishment should have deteriorated, this perspective overlooks several critical issues that undermine the validity of their claims.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>Deterrence Argument:</strong></h4>
      <p>Proponents of the death penalty argue that it serves as a deterrent against violent crime. A study by economist Isaac Ehrlich suggested that for every execution, approximately seven lives were saved due to the deterrent effect of capital punishment.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>Public Safety:</strong></h4>
      <p>Supporters contend that capital punishment is necessary to protect society from dangerous individuals. They argue that executing convicted murderers ensures they cannot commit further crimes by Paul Cassell, a former U.S district court judge.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>Moral Justification:</strong></h4>
      <p>The argument for retributive justice posits that society has a moral obligation to impose the death penalty on those who commit the most heinous crimes. By Charles Stimson, a Former United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>Opinion:</strong></h4>
      <p>In my opinion, the petition for the abolishment of the death penalty is a misguided approach to justice. The death penalty serves as mechanism for delivering justice and ensuring public safety, as a sentence that ensures execution of an offender.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>Support:</strong></h4>
      <p>I believe that death penalty punishment is an unequitable and inhumane justice towards individuals it supports execution rather than punishing the culprit in an utterly manner by maintaining the balance of each existence we must punish the convicted person using by-laws rather than annihilating it to its existence. It revolts the following:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Justice for Victims:</strong> The death penalty provides a sense of justice and closure for victims' families.</li>
        <li><strong>Deterrence of Future Crimes:</strong> Supporters argue that the death penalty serves as a deterrent to violent crime.</li>
        <li><strong>Moral Imperative of Retribution:</strong> The death penalty is seen as a moral imperative that reflects society's values and its commitment to punishing those who commit the worst offenses.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4><strong>Prevention of Wrong Executions:</strong></h4>
      <p>By eliminating death penalty as a punishment, we prevent error of taking an innocent life.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>Addressing Systematic Inequalities:</strong></h4>
      <p>The death penalty improperly affects the communities and make casualties to human dignity.</p>
  
      <h4><strong>Focus on Rehabilitation:</strong></h4>
      <p>Rather than execution we can shift into rehabilitation to make it a safer place to convicts to change.</p>

      <p><strong>CON: Reduced global power balance</strong></p>
      <p>Global power balance is defined as the sharing of political, economic, and military influence among nations in the global system. This aspect allows no one country or grouping of countries to dictate international affairs, thereby promoting interdependence, respect for diversity, and mutual well-being. The lack of a balanced play has caused a great deal of controversy. Nations are increasingly making unilateral moves over collective action, threatening the institutions and alliances that were laid out historically to achieve stability and order in the global arena.</p>
  
      <p>Global power balance has been the most significant factor in maintaining peace throughout history. The fear of getting destroyed is what stopped the United States and the Soviet Union from going head to head during the Cold War. However, the current juggernauts emerging as superpowers, crumbling international alliances, and stark economic inequalities have destroyed the balance.</p>
  
      <p>Reduced global power balance leads to increased geopolitical instability, deepens economic inequalities, and diminishes the capacity for global cooperation, thus necessitating renewed commitment to multilateralism, equitable economic policies, and collaborative diplomacy.</p>
  
  
      <h3>1. The Counterclaim</h3>
  
      <h4>A. Summary of the Counterclaim</h4>
      <p>Advocates of a reduced global power balance believe that decentralization enables nations to act in their interests without being held back by international commitments. They believe that changing power dynamics promote competition, innovation, and the empowerment of smaller nations.</p>
  
      <h4>B. Supporting Evidence for the Counterclaim</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>National Sovereignty:</strong> Reduced dependence on global alliances enables nations to focus on their policies and address domestic issues more effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Competition breeds innovation:</strong> Competition for supremacy leads to economic growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth of Small Powers:</strong> A multinational world would give scope for the hegemony of small powers.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>C. Rebuttal to the Counter-Argument</h4>
      <p>While decentralization has some benefits, it also presents severe risks. National sovereignty generally translates to isolationist policies and does not promote collective action toward a common global good. Besides, uncontrolled competition leads to war, and the differences between powerful and weaker nations increase, where small nations are at risk of exploitation.</p>
  
      <h4>D. Presenting Evidence for the Argument</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Geopolitical Conflicts:</strong> Geopolitical conflicts, such as those in the South China Sea, show how a weakening balance of power leads to instability and flare-ups.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Inequality:</strong> The World Inequality Report shows the richest 10% of the world population owns 76% of the wealth in the world, indicating that the lack of regulation of competition aggravates this economic inequality.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Institution Erosion:</strong> The waning strength of international bodies, including the United Nations and World Trade Organization, depicts how decreasing interdependence can affect global management.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>2. The Argument</h3>
      <p>Petitioning to restore global balance of power is a fundamental step to ensure that there is greater stability, equality, and cooperation in an international order.</p>
  
      <h4>A. Claim #1 Assertion: Geopolitical Stability</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Opinion:</strong> Balance in the power share between nations will avoid wars and achieve peace.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Deters Aggression:</strong> A balanced power sharing does not allow the states to indulge in aggressive practices. The best example for the same is the cold war.</li>
            <li><strong>Facilitates Conflict Resolution:</strong> A multilateral structure facilitates amicable negotiation and diplomacy between the states.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>B. Argument for the Assertion of Claim #2: Economic Fairness</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Opinion:</strong> An equitable world power sharing avoids fraudulent economic practices and ensures protection of small nations against exploitation.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduces Wealth Inequality:</strong> Fair trade agreements and controlled markets eliminate the possibility of powerful nations monopolizing the markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotes Sustainable Development:</strong> Balanced economic policies allow developing countries to acquire resources and technology.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>C. Argument of the Claim #3: International Cooperation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Opinion:</strong> Balanced power sharing fosters cooperation on critical global issues, such as climate change and public health.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Enabling Multilateral Agreements:</strong> With balanced power, every nation, irrespective of its size, would have equal say in global decision-making.</li>
            <li><strong>Addressing Common Challenges:</strong> Collective action is the only way through which common challenges like pandemics and terrorism can be addressed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>B. Developing a Policy Plan</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The promotion of multilateralism:</strong> Strengthening global organizations such as the United Nations and NATO would give rise to an effective and workable global coalition.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic reform:</strong> Provide policies that have less disparity and equal access in resource extraction.</li>
        <li><strong>Encourage Diplomatic Engagement:</strong> Create dialogue among nations in resolving conflicts and promoting mutual understanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Raise Awareness:</strong> Develop global campaigns that educate people on the significance of keeping a balanced power structure in place.</li>
        <li><strong>Invest in Global Institutions:</strong> Allocate financial and logistical resources to international organizations in order to strengthen their capabilities in the resolution of conflicts and the implementation of policies.</li>

      <p><strong>PRO: Banning Transgender Women Athletes to play in women's sports</strong></p>
      <p>Transgender women joining women’s sports has caused a lot of argument between the athletes, sports organizations, and us viewers. This topic is important because it questions what is fair in sports. Even though it’s important to include everyone, banning transgender women keeps things fair for all women athletes.</p>
  
      <h4>1. The Counterclaim</h4>
      <h5>A. Summary of the Counterclaim</h5>
      <p>Some people think that banning transgender women is wrong. They say hormone therapy lowers their strength and makes it fair for them to compete.</p>
  
      <h5>B. Refutation</h5>
      <p>Even if they undergo hormone therapy transgender women still have stronger muscles and bigger lungs even with hormone therapy. According to the British Journal of Sports Medicine, these advantages continue even after a year of hormone therapy.</p>
  
      <h4>2. The Argument</h4>
      <h5>A. Assertion: Transgender women athletes should be prohibited from competing in women’s sports.</h5>
      <p>Opinion: Some people might be against this claim but there are proven facts and studies that can make this claim right.</p>
  
      <h5>B. Support:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Biological Advantage:</strong> A study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that while hormone therapy reduces testosterone levels, the physiological benefits from male puberty like greater muscle and lung capacity remains.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety Concerns:</strong> Physical differences between transgender and cisgender women can create safety risk in contact sports. An incident accord in the first Paris 2024 Olympics happened where Italian boxer Angela Carini entered the ring against Imane Khelif, who was previously banned from competing having been deemed a biological male. Carini surrenders the fight and said he never took a punch that strong from a woman.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact on Women’s Opportunity:</strong> Including transgender women in women’s sports could reduce opportunities for cisgender women, especially in scholarships and career growth. An example of this is Lia Thomas who is a transgender swimmer in the NCAA and won a lot of times against women and is one of the reasons why the controversy about banning trans athletes sparked.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>Fairness in women’s sports should come first. While being welcoming is important, it should not take away the fairness of the competition.</p>
  
      <h3>Action Plan</h3>
      <p>Encourage separate events for transgender athletes to keep women’s sports fair, we can also support more research to create better medicines and rules that is fair for everyone.</p>

      <p><strong>PRO: The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Education</strong></p>
      <p>The use of artificial intelligence in education has indeed given us benefits of its uses, but it also comes with significant drawbacks. The potential for relying on AI, could decline the role of human educators and reduce opportunities for interaction between teachers and student, leading to diminished critical thinking and creativity among students as they become more dependent on automated solutions establishing inequalities in educational access or evaluation. Artificial intelligence provides automated answers or solutions, leaving little room for students to engage in critical thinking or original problem-solving. This will hinder the student’s ability towards exploring creative challenges, such as English writing task, can discourage students from developing unique ideas and expressing themselves in their work which lacks originality. Moreover, students focus on outputs provided by artificial intelligence rather than understanding the concepts.
        This reliance fosters low level engagement with the material, reducing cognitive process necessary for learning, as they rely on artificial intelligence for quick answers increasing the probability of avoiding complex problems or working through mistakes which are the aspects of the learning process.
        </p>
      <p>The importance of this topic is to understand the importance of learning in education through the aspects of learning by making mistakes, because of that artificial intelligence has significantly transformed education in recent years, providing automated solutions that gradually hinders young learners to think critically and creatively. The topic aims to address the negative learning patterns of using artificial intelligence as part of education, which discourage students from engaging deeply with complex problems. Critical thinking is a vital skill in education that requires time, effort, and sometimes struggle to arrive at a solution independently. When AI offers computerized made answers, students may become passive recipients of information rather than being an active participant in their learning process that could potentially erode their ability to evaluate arguments, question assumptions, and develop independent reasoning skills. The cause of the problem that'll be addressed is that many young students tend to rely on artificial intelligence as a source of information, this could heavily impact their cognitive development that they may not develop the ability to analyze situations, evaluate evidence, and form of independent. Lastly, This can lead to a shallow understanding of concepts, as the user may accept answers without questioning or exploring underlying principles. </p>
      <p>Artificial intelligence disrupts the balance of learning by hindering cognitive development, creativity, and critical thinking. Students who rely on AI tools for quick answers develop a shallow understanding of concepts without engaging in deeper learning processes.</p>
  
      <h4>3. The Counterclaim</h4>
      <h5>A. Summary of the Counterclaim</h5>
      <p>AI can revolutionize education by enhancing learning experiences, supporting teachers, and providing personalized learning opportunities for students.</p>
  
      <h5>B. Refutation</h5>
      <p>Despite its potential, AI reduces meaningful interactions between teachers and students, limiting opportunities for students to develop critical thinking and independent learning skills. Overreliance on AI can degrade cognitive abilities, especially in tasks like essay writing and problem-solving.</p>
  
      <h4>4. The Argument</h4>
      <h5>A. Assertion: Overdependence on AI for problem-solving hinders critical thinking and independent learning.</h5>
      <p>Opinion: While AI can enhance learning, excessive reliance on it negatively impacts students' cognitive development and problem-solving skills.</p>
  
      <h5>B. Support:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Photomath Example:</strong> Apps like Photomath provide step-by-step solutions to math problems, which can prevent students from developing their problem-solving abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheating and Academic Dishonesty:</strong> A study found that nearly a third of college students have used ChatGPT for assignments, with many admitting it constitutes cheating.</li>
        <li><strong>Misinformation Risk:</strong> AI-generated information may not always be accurate, leading students to accept incorrect answers without verification or deeper exploration.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h5>Assertion #2: AI can support online learning but may encourage students to avoid engaging with the material.</h5>
      <p>Opinion: While AI can provide efficient explanations, students often use it as a shortcut, bypassing critical thinking and self-learning.</p>
  
      <h5>Support:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>AI can simplify complex topics but may lead to superficial learning.</li>
        <li>Students often face pressure to excel and may resort to AI for assignments instead of seeking clarification from teachers.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>In summary, AI should be used cautiously in education to prevent it from replacing critical thinking and creativity. Students must take responsibility for their learning, and teachers should adopt strategies to minimize AI dependence, such as face-to-face assessments and stricter regulations on AI usage in academic tasks.</p>

      <p><strong>CON: Using artificial intelligence in education</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used more in education, offering tools that could change the way students learn. AI systems can give personalized lessons, grade work, and even help with administrative tasks. However, using AI in education can have negative effects on students' academic performance. While AI programs like DreamBox Learning can give feedback on math problems, they can’t offer the same support, motivation, and help as a human teacher. For example, in science experiments, a teacher’s presence is necessary to make sure students are safe, answer questions, and help them understand the material better. AI may also miss important details about a student’s learning style, which can affect their growth. Because of this, depending too much on AI could hurt students' academic performance by making them rely on technology and missing out on the personal support that teachers provide.</strong></p>
        

        <h4>Counter Claim</h4>
        <p><strong>Claim:</strong> AI can make education more cost-effective by automating administrative tasks and providing scalable learning solutions. For example, artificial intelligence can handle routine tasks such as grading assignments, scheduling and managing student records, freeing up time for educators to focus on teaching.</p>
        <p><strong>Counterclaim:</strong> While AI can make education more cost-effective by automating tasks like grading and managing records, its growing role in the classroom raises concerns about its impact on learning. According to CNN, 30% of college students have used ChatGPT in the past year to supplement their education, demonstrating how quickly AI is being adopted. However, tools like ChatGPT, while efficient, may impair learning when used improperly. They provide quick answers that can tempt students to avoid critical thinking and problem-solving, which are essential for deeper understanding and intellectual growth.</p>
        <p>Additionally, AI tools often present information with confidence, even when they are inaccurate. Students who lack the expertise to recognize these errors may unknowingly rely on faulty information, leading to misunderstandings and poor knowledge retention. These risks underscore the importance of evaluating how AI is integrated into education. While AI can support teachers and students, over-reliance on it without proper guidelines can undermine the educational process and hinder the development of crucial skills.</p>
        <p>While AI has limits, these may be overcome by careful deployment and direction. For example, instructors should train students to check AI-generated knowledge and utilize AI as a complement rather than a replacement for active learning. Additionally, when utilized properly, AI may give useful data insights that allow teachers to personalize their training to the requirements of individual pupils, therefore improving learning results.</p>
        <p>According to studies, artificial intelligence decreases instructors' workloads by automating processes like grading, allowing educators to devote more time to direct student involvement. Furthermore, AI-powered customized learning systems have enhanced student performance by adapting information to specific requirements (McKinsey & Company). With the right standards and equal access, AI may supplement traditional teaching approaches and improve education without eliminating vital human components.</p>


        <h4>Assertion:</h4>
        <p>“Reliance on AI tutors could diminish the vital role of human teachers in fostering critical thinking, social interaction, and emotional development which are all hugely crucial aspects of education.”</p>
        <p>This argument highlights the author's belief that depending on AI may undermine human teachers' vital role in stimulating critical thinking, social connection, and emotional growth, all of which are essential components of education. Lack of Social Interaction Artificial intelligence tutors cannot imitate the social dynamics of a classroom, where students engage with both their classmates and their teacher. Second, AI can hinder students' critical thinking skills, discouraging them from pursuing difficult or conflicting ideas.</p>

        <h4>Assertion:</h4>
        <p>“Artificial Intelligence in education can be both beneficial and detrimental, as it enhances personalized learning and administrative efficiency but also risks diminishing critical thinking skills and reducing opportunities for meaningful social interaction among students.”</p>
        <p>The statement emphasizes the dual nature of artificial intelligence (AI) in education, reflecting both good and negative implications. On the plus side, AI improves customized learning by tailoring lectures to each student's specific requirements and speed. It also boosts administrative productivity by automating processes like grading and scheduling. However, there are certain disadvantages to its incorporation. Over-reliance on AI may impede critical thinking skills, as students may seek answers from AI rather than building problem-solving talents. Furthermore, AI might limit social contact among students, which is critical for developing communication and teamwork skills.</p>

        <h4>Assertion:</h4>
        <p>“Through adaptive learning technologies, artificial intelligence can analyze a student’s strengths, weaknesses, learning pace and preferences.”</p>
        <p>Although adaptive learning technology may assess a student's strengths, weaknesses, learning rate, and preferences, this method has severe limits. Learning is influenced by emotional, social, and cultural variables that artificial intelligence frequently ignores. Educators provide crucial insights and flexibility by understanding nonverbal signs and addressing individual needs in ways that AI cannot mimic. Furthermore, AI systems may perpetuate biases in their training data, resulting in unjust outcomes, and they may oversimplify learning methods, providing inflexible categorizations that do not convey the whole complexity of a student's talents. If we rely too heavily on technology, we risk missing out on collaborative, interactive, and critical thinking opportunities that are crucial for holistic education. While AI may give help, it should complement rather than replace the dynamic function of humans.</p>


        <p>In summary. The use of AI in education should be strictly controlled since it jeopardizes the crucial role that human teachers play in developing critical thinking, generating meaningful social relationships, and promoting emotional growth. These are qualities of teaching that require empathy, understanding, and human connection, which AI cannot mimic. If we allow AI to take over these responsibilities, we risk creating a disconnected, unproductive learning environment that may affect kids' overall development. By restricting AI's involvement, we ensure that education remains focused on human interactions, which are critical for developing well-rounded, thinking persons.</p>
        <p>To address this risk, rigorous procedures should be adopted to prevent the incorporation of AI instructors into education. Schools and politicians should prioritize investing in human teachers by offering training to improve their abilities to mentor, encourage, and motivate kids. AI can be used in non-teaching jobs such as administrative assistance in educational institutions, but all instructional and developmental duties must be performed by human educators. Finally, strong norms and monitoring mechanisms should be developed to govern the usage of technology in education and assure students' overall development.</p>

      <p>CON: Jeepney Modernization</p>
        <p>The jeepney has been apart of us Filipinos ever since World War 2. In fact, the vehicle symbolizes as the ingenuity and innovative minds of the Filipinos. Recently, the jeepney modernization has been an on going issue and is now facing the threat of phaseout. Despite that the government does not have a concrete plan in implementing solutions regarding the issue. Their only initiative is to replace the smoke emitting traditional jeepneys into modern buses. This has caused a feud on jeepney drivers, thus, causing them to stage a noisy protest against such implementations. Although, this is presented as a solution for our environmental concerns. Removing the traditional jeepneys poses big changes for jeepney drivers and also for commuters. With such significant changes we must reconsider the ongoing issue of replacing the traditional jeepneys into modern mini buses.</p>

        <p>Jeepneys are known for being a strong smoke emittor vehicle. This is caused as it lacks proper maintenance. Resulting the jeepney to spew harmful black gases, which is dangerous for the air pollution in some places of our country. Studies have proven that with these conditions it puts the commuters at harm. These vehicles could make the air pollution much worse than it already is. While that is true, it would also be cruel in disregarding the people involved which are the jeepney drivers.  The modernized jeepneys costs around ₱2,000,000 or even more. Although it is possible when taking a loan, Drivers are only given a small amount which they would need earn double to reach such price and also to repay their loans. This may not be possible or affordable to some drivers, leading to them losing their job as a driver and their families losing their support as it is their only primary source of income.</p>

        <p>Firstly, Traditional jeepneys provides efficiency, convenience and accessibility. Most of the commuters riding in these jeepneys are students. As a student being thrifty is not easy, a fare of ₱10, already creates a big change. Commuters are worrying about the replacement of the mode of transportation that they are accustomed to. Traditional jeepneys are the most accessible and affordable type of transportation. Which the commuters, especially students can only afford. Removing these jeepneys may make commuting difficult and expensive.</p>

        <p>Secondly, Traditional jeepneys is a symbol of our cultural identity. We are known for our unique transportation system. These jeepneys are a significant part of the Filipino culture. They show the innovative creativity of us Filipinos. By innovation and creativity, Filipinos were able to repurpose the remnants that the Americans left after the World War 2. These jeepneys has always been apart of our daily lives. They promote out country’s culture and economic heritage.</p>

        <p>Lastly, insufficient government support threatens the lives of jeepney drivers. Jeepney Modernization offers severe consequences for drivers. These drivers depend on traditional jeepneys as their primary source of income. Making them lose their jobs if the jeepneys are replaced. However, the government does not have a concrete plan in this regard. With limited income, drivers are only left with an option of taking a loan. This loan only covers such amount and drivers would need to gain extra in order to make a profit and pay off the loan. How can we expect the drivers to gain such profits when the minimum fare is ₱10. Most of these drivers grew up in poverty making it even harder to earn more.</p>

        <p>Jeepney Phaseout should be reconsidered as it threatens the livelihood of majority of the people. Yes, there is a need to upgrade to a modernized version. But we should also rethink whether what are the consequences of such changes. By implementing solutions like installing eco-friendly engines to reduce air pollution, offer more financial assistance, retaining the traditional design while utilizing the modern technologies, and also, have proper maintenance or regular inspections. We can retain and sustain our very own unique transportation system.</p>

        <p><strong>PRO: Mandatory K-12 education system</strong></p> <p> The K-12 educational reform in the Philippines is currently touted as a step in the progress of education in the country. This circular has positive benefits which include the increase of educational standards, an increase in the country’s international competitiveness and the creation of more informed and competent citizens.</p>
        <p>The Repayment program provides for elementary and secondary education for 12 years, which brings Philippines in line with the global benchmark. This added number of educational years allows for a much wider curriculum thus giving students the ability to acquire various skills and knowledge. Consequently, it is because of this that Filipino graduates have an edge in the job market as workers especially in foreign countries where there is a greater demand for specific skills.</p>
        <p>The two extra years of schooling in basic education give ample chance to the students to take a closer look at certain topics ensuring a greater understanding of fundamental principles. These extra years of education allow studying citizens to cultivate critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity skills which are vital in the 21st century. Additionally, there are more comprehensive understanding of education is encouraged by the K-12 system which includes areas beyond academics’ improvement such as personal and social life improvement.</p>
        <p>The K-12 education system postpones young people's entry into the workforce, giving them time to mature and build a solid foundation for their future careers. This longer educational journey offers plenty of chances for personal growth, exploration of interests, and the cultivation of a strong work ethic. Consequently, K-12 graduates are more equipped to make informed choices about their futures and to contribute positively to society.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In conclusion the K-12 education system represents a significant reform that offers numerous advantages for the Philippines. By aligning the educational framework with global standards, it boosts the international competitiveness of Filipino graduates and equips them with essential skills for success in today’s workforce. The extra years of learning promote a deeper understanding, critical thinking, and creativity, helping students effectively tackle academic, personal, and social challenges. Additionally, the later entry into the workforce allows for personal growth, ensuring that young individuals are better prepared to contribute meaningfully to society. The K-12 system is not just an extension of education; it is an investment in the future of the nation and its people.</p>

        <p>The K-12 education program was welcomed in the Philippines to enhance the quality of education and align it with international standards. By extending basic education from 10 to 12 years, the education program aims to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge for better education, employment, and global competitiveness. Despite its goals, some have called for its removal due to implementation challenges and perceived financial burdens.</p>

        <p>Before K-12, the education system was one of the shortest, which placed graduates at a disadvantage in higher education and the international job market. The K-12 program addresses this gap by providing students with two additional years of education to better prepare them for future opportunities. However, opposition to the program cites issues such as resource limitations, additional costs, and a perceived lack of benefits.</p>

        <p>The removal of the K-12 program would hinder the progress of the education system, reduce the competitiveness of students, and reverse the strides made toward addressing global standards and readiness.</p>

        <p>Critics argue that the K-12 program imposes financial burdens on families, stretches already limited educational resources, and unnecessarily prolongs the time students spend in school.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial Burden:</strong> The additional two years require increased spending on tuition, school materials, and other educational costs.</p>
        <p><strong>Resource Limitations:</strong> The lack of classrooms, trained teachers, and learning materials gives the program’s effectiveness.</p>
        <p><strong>Extended Schooling:</strong> Critics believe that the additional years delay students' entry into the workforce.</p>

        <p>While these concerns are valid, they are not guaranteed. Financial challenges can be done through government subsidies and scholarship programs for low-income families. Additionally, resource issues highlight the need for investment in education rather than stopping the program. The two extra years of schooling enhance students' readiness for the workforce, ultimately providing benefits that outweigh the temporary drawbacks.</p>

        <p>A study conducted by the PBEd found that K-12 graduates are more employable due to their exposure to technical and overall tracks. Furthermore, countries with longer education cycles, such as Japan and South Korea, consistently rank higher in educational performance assessments.</p>

        <p><strong>Claim #1: Enhancing Global Competitiveness</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> The K-12 program aligns the education system with global standards, ensuring that Filipino graduates are not at a disadvantage when competing internationally.</p>
        <p><strong>Support:</strong> Many countries, including the United States and most of Europe, have adopted 12-year basic education systems. Without K-12, students would lack the qualifications required for foreign universities and international job markets.</p>

        <p><strong>Claim #2: Bridging the Skills Gap</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> The K-12 program addresses the skills mismatch between graduates and workforce requirements by integrating technical-vocational education into the curriculum.</p>
        <p><strong>Support:</strong> Senior high school offers tracks that prepare students for specific careers/jobs, allowing them to join the workforce directly after graduation if they choose not to pursue higher education. Employers have also reported greater satisfaction with K-12 graduates due to their improved preparedness and skillsets.</p>

        <p><strong>Claim #3: Promoting Holistic Education</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> The additional years in K-12 allow for a more comprehensive and in-depth approach to learning.</p>
        <p><strong>Support:</strong> The program not only promotes academic excellence but also critical thinking, leadership, and life skills. This holistic approach ensures that students are better prepared for the challenges of higher education and real-world applications.</p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
        <p>The K-12 education program is a crucial form that enhances the global competitiveness of students, bridges the skills gap, and promotes holistic learning. Removing it would hinder the progress made in aligning the education system with international standards and in preparing students for future challenges.</p>

        <p>Rather than eliminating the K-12 program, the government should focus on improving its benefits. This includes increasing funding for educational infrastructure, providing teacher training programs, and offering financial assistance to families in need. By addressing these challenges, the Philippines can fully realize the benefits of K-12 and ensure that education remains a cornerstone of national development.</p>

        <p>The K-12 program is not without its flaws, but its benefits far outweigh the challenges. Removing it would be a disservice to the nation's youth, whose future depends on a strong and competitive education system.</p>

        <p><strong>CON: Illegalizing Abortion in the Philippines</strong> </p><p>I strongly disagree with the illegalization of abortion in the Philippines because women should have the right to decide what to do with their own bodies, and restricting abortion does not give considerations to critical circumstances like unplanned pregnancies due to assault and perpetuates a lack of progress rooted in outdated, religion-based reasoning.</p>
        <p>The issue of abortion remains highly toxic in the Philippines due to its strong religious influence. However, this position ignores the women’s autonomy and fails to address the complex realities many women face. The illegalization of abortion disregards a woman’s right to make decisions about her body, especially in situations where the pregnancy was not a choice. By aligning laws with religious beliefs rather than evidence-based reasoning, the Philippines continues to lag behind other nations in terms of social and economic progress.</p>
        <p><strong>Arguments Supporting the Position:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. A woman’s body is her own, and she has the right to make decisions about it.</strong> Denying access to safe and legal abortion is a violation of this fundamental right. Women should not be forced to carry pregnancies they do not want, particularly when these pregnancies arise from traumatic experiences, such as rape or incest. Forcing women into motherhood under such circumstances is both unjust and inhumane.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Not every pregnancy is the result of a consensual decision.</strong> Many young girls in the Philippines become pregnant due to a lack of sex education or sexual violence. Without access to abortion, they are left with limited choices, which often results in long-term emotional, social, and economic struggles. Legalizing abortion would provide these women with a safe option to regain control over their futures.</li>
            <li><strong>3. Religion Should Not Dictate National Laws.</strong> The Philippines’ anti-abortion stance is rooted in its deeply religious culture, particularly its Catholic majority. While religion plays a significant role in many Filipinos’ lives, laws governing the country should prioritize logic, science, and the well-being of its citizens rather than purely religious beliefs. Countries that base policies on evidence rather than religion have shown better social and economic development compared to the Philippines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Counterclaim:</strong> Opponents of abortion argue that life begins at fertilization and that abortion is morally equivalent to taking a life. While this belief is valid for some, it is a religious perspective and should not be imposed on everyone, especially in a diverse society. The government should follow individual freedoms rather than enforcing one religious viewpoint on all citizens.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The illegalization of abortion in the Philippines harms women’s rights, public health, and the country’s progress. By focusing on religious beliefs instead of facts, the country takes away women’s freedom to decide and worsens poverty and inequality. The Philippines should create policies that respect women’s rights and address the realities of today’s world.</p>
